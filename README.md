# RecipeApp-latest
Simple Recipe App where you can create and manage your own recipe

Language Used: Kotlin
Storage Method Used: Share Preferences 

I did not have to time to pre-populate the app with recipes. However user should still be able to populate it successfully.
Recipes is filterable according to types given in spinner

Thank you for taking your time to look at this and I sincerely hope to still improve on it in the future!
